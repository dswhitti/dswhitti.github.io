		The video project we were given tasked us to work in groups and create a video highlighting one major aspect of campus (e.g. the dining hall or gym.)
		<br><br>
		For my group this project was done alongside felow classmates Jordan Alexander and Enzo Bellini, focusing on the Trick or Treat Trail event from last Halloween. Jordan and Enzo primarily worked as actors, whereas I focused on most of the background work like general planning, tripod shots, and editing. 
		<br><br>
		This is not a project I particularly like looking back on for a variety of factors. Primarily, I ran into issues of us only having one day to properly film and there being a whole cascade of scheduling issues for the event itself, leading to a whole <i>bunch</i> of messy shots and lack of communication for how certain ones should be laid out, not to mention there being key shots that weren't recorded until the day before submission leading to a late night editing cram session on a program I only learned a week before.
		<br><br><i>
		(To clarify this was due to a chain of miscommunication and poor scheduling, not gonna throw anyone under the bus specifically as I def could have been a lot clearer how things were going and tried to coordinate better.)
		</i><br><br>
		In the end the video turned out alright and we got a grade I thought was fitting. Looking back I can def tell I learned a lot about coordination and making sure plans are adhered to when doing a project, as well as communicating what aspects of a project need coordination to achive a good final result.
